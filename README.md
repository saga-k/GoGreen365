# Tech stack and installation instructions

This project is built using Vue 3 along with Vite as the build tool, Pinia for state management, and Vue Router for routing. It also uses json-server to manage JSON data files located in the public folder. Additional tooling includes ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grupp_5.git
cd grupp_5
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Using npm:

```
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```
yarn install
```

## Development

### Running the Dev Server

Start the development server with Vite:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (the URL may vary if configured differently).

### Running json-sever

This project uses two JSON files located in the public folder:

challenges.json
userdata.json
These files serve as data sources for the project. Start the server with a command such as:

```
npx json-server --watch public/challenges.json
```

or

```
npm json-server --watch public/challenges.json
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see json-server data.
